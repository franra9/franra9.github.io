# Last trip to Innsbruck!
## (without the MSc) 

Nearly three years ago, in the middle of a pandeminc that we thought was a matter of months to be gone I left my collegues in BSC to start an adventure in the heart of the Alps. Mountain meteorology and glaciers was a thing that always caught my attention and in Innsbruck I was able to find this... and even more! I remember that the study of how atmosphere would affect the evolution of the glaciers was something I wanted to learn about, and to learn that, one should know about atmosphere and glaciers.

A tough start with online lectures was given to all of us. I don't want to extend on this, just to say that (bad) luck allowed me start a full semester in presence... when I had no more lectures to attend to!

After some days of foehn, snow, high temperatures, thunderstorms and pictures to all type of clouds (yes, we have a whatsapp group where to share cloudpics) I was about to start the master's thesis about the future evolution of Aneto glacier, the biggest in the Pyrenees. Even though I had already in mind that I would not stay in the field of glaciology, I still found extreme timely and important to project the evolution of Aneto, as we are the first and at the same time last generation able to do so. Therefore I forwarded this idea to Fabien, who accepted it but at the same time proposed some other interesting topics.

(... 9 months pass and no thesis was born, so far...)

It was already November and I got a position in the BSC to start in mid-January in the framework of the Destination Earth project. I convinced myself that I would have the thesis finished by Christmas to start the new job "clean". The wishes do not always come true, so you can picture myself working some extra hours on it to finally submit it by May.

*Spoiler: it is going to melt somewhere between 2037 and 2048*

And here I am somewhere in the Mediterranean sea on the "Roma" ferri, coming back with the energy of a well deserved break and without any to-do left in Tirol, apart from the will of visiting my friends from time to time and to see if the glaciers are still there.
